"DevOps Solutions to Traditional IT Challenges" presentation for IT Best Practices Greater Philadelphia User Group

This presentation is catered to IT professionals who are new to Vagrant and Puppet.  The goal was to explore possibilities with Puppet for Windows.  The primary objective is to create a pluggable workstation for a new employee.  Although there are other tools out there, Puppet handles this job reasonably well.

I built this with reveal.js <http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/> and highlight.js <https://highlightjs.org/>.  Fun tools, and they look super slick.

Clone the repo, then open presentation/vagrant-puppet.html.  Enjoy the rebus puzzles (my high school students loved them!)

##Puppet
Ensure you've installed Vagrant <http://vagrantup.com>.  Then, use the vagrant/Vagrantfile I've provided.  There are detailed instructions in the vagrant and puppet subdirectories.
