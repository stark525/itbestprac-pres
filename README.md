"DevOps Solutions to Traditional IT Challenges" presentation for IT Best Practices Greater Philadelphia User Group

This presentation is catered to IT professionals who are new to Vagrant and Puppet.  The goal was to explore possibilities with Puppet for Windows.  The primary objective is to create a pluggable workstation for a new employee.  Although there are other tools out there, Puppet handles this job reasonably well.
